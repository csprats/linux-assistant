# Description

This assistant can help you run some Linux commands, making them simpler and easier to execute.
It's written in Bash and can be run in the terminal not only on Linux but also on Windows, macOS, and so on. However, with the caveat that you may need to change the assistant's commands slightly.

# How to use


To start using this assistant, you must launch it in the Linux console. Once you've done this, you can run these commands:
- open: open archives with nano.
- date: change the date.
- search: open the explorer and search whit google.
- node: open archives whit node.
- git: git functions: 
-   - pull
-   - push
-   - add
-   - comment
-   - exit

Over time I will add more commands.
